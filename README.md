# PicoPendant
A small CNC Pendant based off the Raspberry Pi Pico W and the Waveshare Pico-ResTouch-LCD-3.5

## Folders
* CircuitBoard<br>This contains the circuit board (display hat) files and readme. The circuit board has two LiPo connectors (small and regular), a LiPo charger, three encoder inputs, three A/D dividers for ladder switches and one switch input.
* Enclosure<br>This contains a Fusion360 workspace for 3d printing an enclosure and spacers. The spacers are used to support the display hat over the Waveshare LCD. Since the hole locations are not exact and Jlcpcb seems unable to put holes in the right place anyway, the spacers are slightly offset.
* PythonSrc<br>The MicroPython source code
