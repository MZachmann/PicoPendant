#CircuitBoard
This folder contains the json files for EasyEda as well as a few images to show the board.

There is a version 1.02 board that moves the parts to the left and the connectors inward but I haven't finalized the PCB and probably never will since the 1.01 board works fine for me but is a bit wider than desired.

Note that the power test pin should be jumpered in normal use.
